# shoto

A terminal-first focused and execution assistant.

## What it does
1. Capture intent
2. Enforce focus
3. Reflect reality

## What it is NOT
- Not a task manager
- Not a calendar
- Not a habit app
- Not a pomodoro clone
- Not a journaling app

No cloud. No accounts. No dopamine dashboards.
Just you, your terminal, and receipts.
